    "I'm not 100% sure we would need them. Why wouldn't there be baryonic galaxies - after all initial perturbations could come all together from baryonic density perturbations. The issue is that then we can't reconstruct galaxy cluster velocities or get accurate mass estimates for them, or can we get a correct estimate of the z at which first galaxies would have formed (as dark matter perturbations began growing much earlier, baryons effectively trace out the structure already put in place by dark matter), nor could we explain the rotational curves of galaxies - so the assumption is that there must've been dark matter early on and that it does contributed to the perturbations and ergo the played a role in formation of galaxies. But still not sure why they would not form if not for dark matter."
